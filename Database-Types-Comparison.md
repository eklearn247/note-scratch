# Database Types Comparison

| **Type** | **Description** | **Key Features** | **Examples** |
|----------|-----------------|------------------|--------------|
| **Relational Databases** | Store data in tables with rows and columns. | Structured approach using SQL; strong consistency; transaction management. | MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle |
| **NoSQL Databases** | Handle large, unstructured/semi-structured data. | Flexible schema; scalable; multiple subtypes. | MongoDB, Redis, Cassandra, Neo4j |
| ├─ Document DBs | Store data in documents (e.g., JSON). | Flexible data models. | MongoDB |
| ├─ Key-Value Stores | Store data as key-value pairs. | High speed, simplicity. | Redis |
| ├─ Wide-Column Stores | Store data in columns. | Optimized for large read/write ops. | Cassandra |
| └─ Graph Databases (NoSQL variant) | Represent relationships between data points. | Uses nodes/edges. | Neo4j |
| **Object-Oriented Databases** | Store data as objects. | Matches OOP concepts; handles complex data structures. | db4o, ObjectDB |
| **Graph Databases** | Focus on relationships between data points. | Ideal for social networks, fraud detection. | Neo4j, Amazon Neptune |
| **Cloud Databases** | Hosted on cloud platforms. | Scalable, flexible, cost-effective; managed services. | AWS RDS, Azure Cosmos DB, Google Cloud SQL |
| **Time Series Databases** | Store and analyze time-stamped data. | Optimized for IoT, finance, sensor data. | InfluxDB, TimescaleDB |
| **Vector Databases** | Store and query high-dimensional vectors. | Used in AI/ML applications. | Pinecone, Milvus |
| **Hierarchical Databases** | Tree-like structure. | Fast for hierarchical data queries. | IBM IMS |
| **Network Databases** | Graph-like relationships. | More complex than hierarchical models. | IDMS |
| **Distributed Databases** | Spread data across multiple machines. | High availability, fault tolerance. | Google Spanner, CockroachDB |
